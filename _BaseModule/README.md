# Dynamic Street Signs
Hello. This mod adds Dynamic Street Signs that displays the Road name. 
Requested by **rzzirrah** this mod was orignially the [North American Street Signs](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/115319/Windows) mod that is outdated,
it got heavily modified to be similar like my Vanilla Overrider.

**This mod is for now just for NA Theme**

**Please use either this or one Vanilla Overrider at one time!**

## Functions
- Variable working Street Signs on Signpost's and also on Traffic Lights!
- Changeable Colors(Blue, White, Green, probably more later)

---

##  Requirements
- [Write Everywhere](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/92908/Windows) – required 100%

##  Credits and Special Thanks
- To **Klyte45** for the WriteEverywhere mod.
- **Klyte45**s [Vanilla Theme Override Mod](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/106877/Windows), without that I would have lost my mind.
